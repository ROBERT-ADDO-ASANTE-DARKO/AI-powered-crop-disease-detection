# Project Overview

This project is a web-based application that utilizes computer vision and natural language processing to detect crop diseases and tomato freshness. The application uses YOLOv8 for object detection and Google's Gemini model for text generation.

## File Structure

The project consists of the following files and directories:

```
models/: Directory containing the pre-trained YOLOv8 models for crop disease detection and tomato freshness detection.
    crop_disease_model.pt
    tomato_freshness_model.pt
app.py: The main application file that defines the Gradio interface and inference functions.
requirements.txt: File containing the required packages for installation.
README.md: This file.
```

## Installation

To install the required packages, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The required packages are:

- `gradio`
- `numpy`
- `opencv-python`
- `Pillow`
- `ultralytics`
- `google-cloud-generativeai`

## Environment Variables

The project requires the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable to be set. You can set it using the following command:

```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual Google API key.

## Running the Application

To run the application, execute the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will launch the Gradio interface, and you can access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:7860` in your web browser.

## Usage

1. Upload an image of a crop or tomato to the application.
2. Select the model type (Crop Disease Detection or Tomato Freshness Detection).
3. Adjust the confidence threshold and IoU threshold as needed.
4. Click the "Submit" button to run the inference.
5. The application will display the processed image and generate a text description of the detected objects.

## Note

This project is for educational purposes only, and the accuracy of the models may vary depending on the quality of the input images and the specific use case.
